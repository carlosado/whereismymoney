## General info
Harvardx CS50 final project. Web app intended to help you quickly grasp your
personal home finances by displaying yearly and monthly income and expenses in
a series of relational charts and tables. Requires user input to build the database.
This can probably be done more eficiently with an excel spreadsheet, but the
motivation here was to deepen my knowledge in all the tecnologies introduced
by the problem set 8 'Finance'.
